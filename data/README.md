## How to generate dataset

The dataset used in this project is generated through code. To generate data, either run dataset.py under code or use the sample_data.py code in this folder. File sample_data.py has two functions: balanced_sampling and random_sampling. Mostly balanced_sampling was used in this project with the "add" configuration. Run the function with the amount of data as the argument, and the function will return two lists: one with the questions already in text form and the other with answers. The indices of the two should correspond with another. To apply input formatting, add the input format function as the format argument (default set to decimal).
